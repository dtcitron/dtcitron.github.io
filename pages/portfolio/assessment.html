    <h1> <b> Assessment of Student Learning </b> </h1>
      <p> Different courses have different objectives, so assessments of student work
      should be tailored to best incentivize them to achieve those objectives.  For
      example, I have found that without a rewards system that encourages students to
      explain their reasoning, students' physics homework sets may include no reasoning
      regardless of whether their answers are mathematically "correct."  To correct this,
      I've come to embrace the idea of using written problem sets to reward
      students for explaining their work, rather than just manipulating equations. </p>
      <p> I've included such an assignment in my example <a href="course_planning.html#syllabus">
      syllabus</a>.  You can find an example of how I would structure the grading scheme
      for a write-up homework assignment <a href="#rubric"> below </a>.  </p>
    <hr>
    <h2> <a name="assessment"> Assessment as Feedback </a> </h2>
      <p>I have found that many of my students are very worried about their grades
      on their homework sets and quizzes.  These students are ambitious and consider
      themselves to be intelligent and hard-working, so it can be unnerving for them to
      receive low scores on assignments. I remember feeling the same way as an
      undergraduate, so I sympathize. </p>
      <p> To alleviate the anxiety associated with small assignments, I believe that
      instructors should make it clear that some assignments are intended as feedback for
      the students themselves.  Rather than seeing a low quiz score as an indication of
      being a bad student, I want my students to see my grading as an indication of what
      areas they can improve upon, or what they need to review for the future. </p>
      <p> In my class for the past two semesters, I have implemented this informally
      without making this distinction explicit.  I use discussion section as an opportunity
      for students to try and figure things out on their own without any fear of making
      mistakes.  Discussion section is a low-stress environment where students can fail
      without consequences as well as learn from their mistakes.  Of course, this is
      different from telling students explicitly that assignments can be thought of as
      feedback rather than judgment, but I will be adopting this new policy for future
      courses.  </p>

    <h2> <a name="rubric"> Sample Rubric </a> </h2>
      <p> Referring back to the sample syllabus that appears under <a href="course_planning.html#syllabus">
      Course Development and Lesson Plans</a>, I mentioned that I would like my future
      students to develop the ability to make clear arguments based on the physics
      concepts that we have covered. Homework sets, rather than featuring plug-and-chug
      problems, would consist of one or two long-form write-up problems. </p>
      <p> Below I have included a grading rubric that communicates to
      students what elements need to be present in their homework sets.  In addition to
      rewarding students for arriving at the correct answer, the grading rubric emphasizes
      organization, clarity, and completeness of the argument.  By making it clear to
      students what a good homework set is expected to look like, I hope to train them in
      good communication habits that will help them in future science courses. </p>
