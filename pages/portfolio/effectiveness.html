    <h1> <b> Evaluating Classroom Effectiveness </b> </h1>
      <p> I strive to employ teaching methods that effectively accomplish the learning 
      objectives that I design into each lesson.  I draw upon my experiences learning 
      physics when I was an undergraduate - What worked for me? What did not work for me?  
      Additionally, I have to remain aware that not all students learn the same as I do, 
      and that I need to adjust my teaching methods to try and reach as many students as 
      possible in each class. This requires me to experiment with new techniques or lesson 
      formats as well as careful evaluation of how successful a lesson or course turned 
      out to be.  </p>
      <p>Assessing students' understanding through assignments and exams is one way to do 
      this, but I also want to maintain an open dialogue with my students about course 
      material as the course progresses. For this reason, soliciting feedback in the 
      middle of the course (after learning a new block of material, say) has become an 
      important practice for me to learn more about how well my students are responding 
      to the teaching methods that I have chosen. </p>

    <h2> <a name="methods"> Teaching Methods </a></h2>
      <p> As a graduate student, I have worked as a TA for four semesters.  My teaching 
      responsibilities were to lead discussion sections and to supervise laboratory 
      experiments.  In discussion sections, I have used brief lectures to review the 
      physics concepts recently covered in lecture.  After the short lecture, I assign 
      practice problems to my students and let them work on their own.  By walking around 
      the classroom and seeing how students are approaching  problems, I can get a sense 
      of how well they understand the material.  </p>
<!-- section about challenging students?  seems like a cool method -->
      <p> Recently I have learned a lot about peer instruction and other active learning
      techniques that give students opportunities to receive feedback from both the 
      instructor and their peers.  For an in-class problem, the instructor begins by 
      asking a question, and students take a short time to come up with what they think is 
      the right answer.  Students then discuss their answers with one another.  
      Following the discussion, students report back their new 
      answers.  (See an example <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wont2v_LZ1E"
      target="_blank"> here</a>.)  This procedure has proven to be 
      <a href="https://vimeo.com/62359365" target="_blank">very effective</a> at getting 
      students to reconsider their assumptions and practice their reasoning.  Given the 
      opportunity to design and teach a full course in the future, I intend to experiment 
      with peer instruction to see how students respond.</p>
    <h2> <a name="evals"> Post-Semester Student Evaluations </a>  </h2>
      <p>Below is one of the end-of-semester course evaluations that I received from my 
      students as a teaching assistant for Physics 1116: Mechanics and Special Relativity 
      in the Fall of 2015. </p>
        <div class = "imgholder"><img src = "evaluation.jpeg" alt="" height="450"></div>
      <p> <b>Student comments</b> </p>
      <ul>
        <li> "Daniel is extremely nice and very helpful. He is also available for help and 
        is very understanding of everyone in the class having different expectations of what 
        they want from the course. He is fairly approachable and good at explaining things, 
        even if he has to think of a different way to present something because you didn't 
        understand the first [time]." </li>
        <li> "Daniel should be a professor." </li>
      </ul>
      <h2> Annotations </h2>
      <ul>
<!--        <li>
          <p class="flip"><b> <u> <font color= #880000> Outlier: Quiz Difficulty </font> </u> </b></p>
            <div class="panel">
              <p> The one aggregate score that seems significantly different from the others is for Question 10, which asks about the appropriate difficulty level of the quizes given in class.  Once a week I would give my students a quiz in discussion section.  The quizzes contained questions similar to the ones that appeared on the past week's homework set.  Quiz grades served as a compliment to the grade given for homework - since students could work with others to complete the homework sets, quizzes showed us how well they worked on their own. </p>
              <p> When administering the test, I found that occasionally the tests were too complicated - the students needed more time, sometimes 20-25 minutes instead of the intended 15.  Occasionally, students would find typos or other errors that made the questions ambiguous, which required me to clarify the questions.</p>
              <p> What I have learned from this is that I need to be careful when designing exam questions in the future.  I believe that a safe way to go would be to ask another course instructor to look over my quiz questions to ensure that they are worded clearly and meet the appropriate difficulty level. </p>

          <p class="flip"><b> <u> <font color= #880000> Utility to Me </font> </u> </b></p>
            <div class="panel">
              <p> End-of-semester course evaluations are useful for some things - I can 
              see some evaluations of general aspects of the course and whether students 
              thought that I handed them well.  Here, for example, I can see that students 
              did not think that the quizzes I assigned during discussion section were 
              appropriately difficult - this is something that I can re-examine and 
              improve upon the next time I design quizzes or exams. </p>
              <p> There is a lot more information about my teaching, however, that I would 
              like to find out from my students that is not covered in this evaluation.  
              Many of the questions are more related to my presence in the classroom than 
              to how effectively I managed to convey the course materials.  A student who 
              left this course fundamentally confused about special relativity, for 
              example, might still say my skills as a teacher deserve a "5."  </p>
              <p> Furthermore, it is a little disappointing to see that only 5 out of the 
              19 students in my discussion section responded to this survey.  The sample 
              size is too small to judge whether it represents the general attitude of all 
              students in the class as a whole. (Currently, Cornell does not incentivize 
              students to fill out course evaluations, so I can really only expect a few 
              students to do so.)</p> 
            </div>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p class="flip"><b> <u> <font color= #880000> Utility to Students </font> </u> </b></p>
            <div class="panel">
              <p> End-of-course evaluations are also not particularly useful to students.  
              It is unlikely that they will see the benefits of any changes that I make to 
              future courses based on their feedback here. </p> 
              <p>Much more useful to the students themselves would be mid-course feedback. 
              As an instructor, I can ask students questions specific to the content and 
              structure of my course.  Instead of only asking "how is my teaching?" I can 
              ask questions such as, "Would you like me spend more time lecturing, or would 
              you prefer more time to study and practice with the material on your own?"  
              or, "Is there a topic that you feel we spent an insufficient amount of time 
              studying?"  With these mid-course evaluations, I as the instructor can 
              choose to change the course according to what the students need.  After all, 
              I believe that time is wasted on long derivations copied from the textbook, 
              but it may be that in my next course the students will desire a more 
              mathematically rigorous curriculum and want me to explain those proofs 
              in greater detail.</p>
            </div>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p class="flip"><b> <u> <font color= #880000> Experimenting with Mid-Course Evaluations </font> </u> </b></p>
            <div class="panel">
              <p> In the Spring of 2016, immediately after the first prelim exam, I asked 
              my students to turn in anonymous feedback on how they felt course was going.  
              I asked them four questions: </p>
              <ol>
                <li> What actions did you take to prepare for the test? </li>
                <li> How prepared did you feel while taking the test? </li>
                <li> Did any of the questions surprise you? </li>
                <li> Is there anything you would like to change about the course? </li>
              </ol> 
              <p> With the first three questions, I wanted students to reflect upon how 
              they studied for the exam, as well as whether or not they felt that they 
              had prepared enough.  Interestingly, most of the students did say that they 
              felt sufficiently prepared and that none of the questions surprised them, 
              even though the majority of the class failed to solve one of the test 
              questions correctly - to me this indicated that the physic concepts 
              related to that question that needed some reinforcement. </p>
              <p> For the last question, a majority of students all said the same thing: 
              they wanted less time spent deriving formulas, and more time spent 
              discussing applications of the concepts.  They felt unprepared to work on 
              their homework sets, as they would often spend lecture learning where an 
              equation came from but not learn any ways to actually calculate something 
              with it. (This can be particularly daunting in any course that uses 
              Maxwell's equations, which are straightforward to write down but difficult 
              to use.)  Subsequently I relayed this information to the lecturer and also 
              adjusted the problems covered in my discussion sections to connect more 
              explicitly to the theorems from lecture.  </p>
              <p> Overall, this experiment with implementing mid-semester evaluations into 
              the format of the course helped me to better understand how my students were 
              learning and what I could do to be more effective.  I will definitely 
              continue to solicit evaluations and feedback from students in future courses.
