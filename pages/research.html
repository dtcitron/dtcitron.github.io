    <p> How do scientific fields develop?  How does the underlying social structure of
    scientific research change as a little-known idea or discovery grows into a
    well-established new field?
    </p>
    <p>The <a href="http://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/50230" target="_blank">
    work of David Kaiser and Luis Bettencourt</a> has shown that over time,
    as more researchers enter a new field
    and work with others, enough collaborative ties form such that the initial cohort of
    disjointed research groups joins together to form a giant, densely connected component.
    (One can see two examples of this process in the co-authorship networks of
    quantum computing and ultracold atoms, shown above.)  The densely connected component
    formation represents social restructuring on a global scale, as scientists establish
    new research groups; new collaborations develop; and the community agrees upon a set
    of shared tools, techniques, and terminology for communicating ideas.
    </p>
    <p>How robust is this pattern?  To answer this question, I have used standard topic
    modeling software (<a href="http://mallet.cs.umass.edu" target="_blank">Mallet</a>) to
    sort the articles available on <a href="http://www.arxiv.org">the arXiv</a> according
    to scientific subtopics.  I find that the majority of topics detected with Mallet
    reflect real, established scientific fields, and that for many of these topics we do
    find the emergence of a densely connected giant component in the corresponding
    co-authorship network.  These results are quantitative evidence of the social
    restructuring that occurs as scientific fields develop.

    <p>The arXiv is an online repository of scientific articles available publicly at
    <a href="http://www.arxiv.org"><b>arxiv.org</b></a>. At the time when this project
    began (Summer 2012), administrators of the arXiv had become increasingly aware of
    instances of authors repeatedly copying text from previously published material.
    This included cases of plagiarism as well as less egregious but still problematic
    cases of authors repeatedly submitting the same material with minor superficial
    changes. Needless to say, arXiv administrators were concerned about this reported
    behavior, and wanted to know more about the problem. How frequently did authors use
    copied material? Was copying behavior restricted to a particular subset of authors,
    or did everybody reuse text sometimes? Did articles featuring copied material garner
    much attention in terms of citations? </p>
    <p> My role in the project was to compile the data into a format where it could be
    analyzed in a meaningful way.  I created a "text overlap network," in which nodes
    represented articles and edges represented pairwise text overlap between the two
    articles. In this new format the data could be easily visualized and explored using
    standard network analysis tools. This enabled us to answer a lot of questions regarding
    the behavior of the community of scientists submitting to arXiv. For example, we
    found that the vast majority of authors did not reuse text from others' articles,
    that instead only a few authors habitually reused text. We also discovered that articles
    containing a large amount of copied material tended to earn fewer citations, suggesting
    that these articles were produced on the fringes of the scientific community. </p>

  <a><h2>Network Heterogeneity and Spontaneous Extinction of Endemic Disease</h2></a>
  <p>Numerous studies have suggested that the structure of the contact network in a
  susceptible population is crucial for understanding the progression of an outbreak of
  disease, as well as suggesting strategies for combating epidemics.  In the context of
  recurrent or endemic disease, the notion of "critical community size" was introduced
  to explain why larger populations tend to sustain outbreaks for longer periods of time
  than smaller populations.  The random events that make up an epidemic- infection,
  recovery, migration- lead to stochastic fluctuations.  Smaller populations have larger
  fluctuations, making it more likely for a fluctuation to spontaneously send the number
  of infected individuals to zero.</p>
  <p>The role of fluctuations and their relationship to spontaneous extinction is not yet
  understood in the context of contact networks: the contact networks underlying the
  interactions between different members of a population may vary dramatically between
  different types of populations.  How does a network's structure affect its potential
  for sustaining endemic diseases? I have used simulations in conjunction with
  analytical moment closure techniques to explore this question, and have found that a
  graph's structural heterogeneity can have significant effects on the size of
  fluctuations and the rate of extinction.</p>
  <p>My poster on this topic titled "Accounting for Fluctuations in Stochastic SIRS
  Model on Networks" from the Advances in Discrete Networks workshop I attended at the
  University of Pittsburgh in December 2014 can be found <a href="DTCitron_SIRS_poster.pdf">

  <!--    <p><b>Stochastic Modeling of Disease Dynamics on Networks</b></p>
  <p>Beginning in the Summer of 2013, I have worked on the
  Susceptible-Infected-Recovered-Susceptible (SIRS) model of infectious
  disease dynamics on networks. SIRS is a simple model in which susceptible
  individuals become sick by interacting with infected individuals.  Infected
  individuals develop immunity to the disease and recover, but over time they lose
  that immunity and become susceptible to the disease again.  Because recovered
  individuals are recycled back into the pool of susceptibles, the SIRS model supports
  a long-term active state representing endemic disease.</p>
  <p>The major question that the SIRS model poses is when does a population support
  endemic disease, and when does endemic disease die out? In a stochastic model like
  this one, there are random fluctuations that may cause any endemic disease to die
  out spontaneously.  We have used moment-closure techniques taken from the study of
  stochastic processes to try and understand when these fluctuations are relevant.</p>
  <p>Models of disease dynamics in which the population is fully mixed (with all
  individuals touching all others) are not always accurate, as they do not take
  into account that some individuals have many more contacts than others ("degree
  heterogeneity").  We are working on extending previous work on the stochastic SIRS
  model to determine how the structure of the network of contacts between individuals
  affects the population's ability to support endemic disease.</p>

  <a><h2>Simulating Disease Dynamics on Networks</h2></a>
  <p>I have developed a number of Python scripts for simulating stochastic models of
  disease dynamics in fully mixed populations and on networks.  I have used these
  simulations extensively for exploring the stochastic SIRS model described above.</p>
  <ul>
    <li> <p> <b>sirs_gsp</b> - "SIRS Gillespie Dynamics" - This is an implementation of Gillespie's exact algorithm for fully mixed populations in Python.  I am currently working on implementing this same script with multi-threading in Julia, which I expect will make everything much faster.</p>
    <p class="readmore"><a href="https://github.com/dtcitron/sirs_gsp"><b>Code on GitHub &raquo;</b></a></p></li>
    <li> <p> <b>gdy</b> - "Graph Dynamics" - This employs the networkx and scipy.sparse libraries in Python to perform fast simulations of SIR, SIRS, and SIS models on a networked population.  These simulations are carried out discrete time with synchronous updating as an approximation to the full continuous time Markov Chain model.</p>
