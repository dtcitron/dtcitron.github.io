<h1> Nothing is Normal Anymore </h1>
<p>
Following the results of the 2016 American Presidential election, the world has felt twisted
and unfamiliar.  Reality has been replaced with unreality.
</p>

<!--<p>
Rather than electing a competent, experienced executive, American has elected a vulgar, 
childish, selfish, vain, hateful, inexperienced egomaniac to the highest office in the land.  
America has trusted this person with representing its national interest abroad, defending 
the rights of its citizens, and enforcing the laws that make life in America 
</p>
-->

<p>
I have found that most news sources, in an attempt to remain detached and impartial, write
their headlines with neutral language that does not reflect the expressionistic nightmare 
that US national politics has become.  To fix this problem,  I have taken a cue from 
Jon Stewart, <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEEgplXwNWk">who in 2013 dubbed 
our President Elect "VonClownstick," prompting a twitter war</a> in which the President 
Elect simultaneously revealed his fragility and complete lack of a sense of humor.

<p>
Waking up every day to headlines about a buffoon with a proportionally silly 
name will prevent complacency and avoid normalizing the new state of affairs. 
The <b>VonClownstick web browser extension</b> replaces the name of our President Elect 
to drive home how nothing is normal anymore.  This will not make the news any 
less dire, but at the very least it now looks as bizarre as it feels.
